# TypeScript Libs

Monorepo for holding some of my npm packages.

Packages and their respective READMEs can be found in `libs` folder. These include but are not limited to:

* [@ns3/rx-state](libs/rx-state)
* [@ns3/rx-actions](libs/rx-actions)
* [@ns3/react-di](libs/react-di)
* [@ns3/react-utils](libs/react-utils)
* [@ns3/http-client](libs/http-client)
* [@ns3/ts-utils](libs/ts-utils)

Most of there are showcased in `react-demo` application in this repository.

To start demo run:

* `yarn` - to install dependencies
* `yarn nx run react-demo:serve` - to serve Next.js react application.
